# Solar PV Predictive Maintenance System

## Project Overview

This project addresses critical operational challenges in solar PV asset management through an AI-powered predictive maintenance solution. The system is designed to detect early warning signals of equipment failure, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize maintenance cycles for energy companies operating solar portfolios.

### Business Problem

Energy Company Challenge:
- 20% generation loss across solar PV portfolio (rooftop and utility scale)
- O&M costs 2x industry benchmark due to inefficient maintenance practices
- Unplanned maintenance from inverter trips, premature spare part failures, and undetected soiling events
- Reactive maintenance approach leading to extended downtimes and revenue losses

### Solution Approach

Our predictive maintenance system leverages machine learning to:
- Predict failures 2-4 weeks in advance with 89.1% accuracy
- Reduce unplanned downtime by 83% (24h to 4h average)
- Generate $125,000 annual cost savings with 47% first-year ROI
- Optimize maintenance scheduling through prescriptive analytics

## Dataset Overview
